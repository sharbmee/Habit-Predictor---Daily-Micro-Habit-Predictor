# HabitPredict 🧘‍♂️📊

A simple habit tracking and prediction web app built with **HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **add new habits**, track completion, visualize skip risk, and manage daily routines in an interactive way.

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Add new habits with name, best time, and duration.
